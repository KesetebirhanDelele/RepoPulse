RepoPulse — Multi-Repo Progress Scoreboard (Public GitHub, Read-Only)

You are a senior Python engineer + systems architect. Help me build RepoPulse, a local-first Python app that tracks daily/weekly progress across ~30 public GitHub repos (one per developer) where I only have read access. RepoPulse must generate a dashboard and CSV exports that summarize progress, flag risks (docs/CI gaps, churn risk), and help me decide which repos need deep-dive review (download locally).

NEW REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL): Repo signals are first-class inputs

RepoPulse must treat signals (commits, CI status, tags/releases, docs presence, README status block) as first-class inputs.

Signal definitions and scoring rules MUST be external config files under configs/ (YAML/JSON).

No hardcoding of scoring thresholds or required-file lists in code.

CLI MUST support overriding config paths at runtime.

CONTEXT / GOALS

Each developer has their own public repo (not a shared repo).

I need a daily progress snapshot and a weekly scoreboard to run an “architecture & delivery” weekly call.

I will do deep dives by downloading repos locally (shallow clone or zip), but RepoPulse must work even without local clones.

RepoPulse should help answer:

Which repos moved since last check?

Which repos look stuck (no pushes, CI failing, etc.)?

Which repos show churn risk (activity without deliverable signals)?

Which repos lack minimum architecture hygiene (missing docs pack, CI)?

What’s the 1–2 line “what changed” summary per repo for the weekly call?

NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS

Read-only GitHub compatible

Must work on public repos with read access only.

Use GitHub API with token for reliability, but must gracefully degrade without token.

Daily snapshots + weekly rollups

RepoPulse runs daily (manual CLI run is fine for MVP).

It stores snapshots and can produce weekly reports (“since last Wednesday”).

Dashboard + CSV export

Local dashboard: simple web UI (FastAPI + HTML or Streamlit).

Export CSV for:

latest daily snapshot

weekly snapshot for meeting

Signals collected per repo (API-only)

Last commit timestamp (freshness)

Commits in last 24h / 7d

Top files changed (from commit details, limited sample)

CI/Actions latest run status (success/failure/none)

Open issues count (if enabled; otherwise “n/a”)

Latest tag/release (if any)

README updated in last 7d (detect by SHA or commit file changes)

Required docs existence (by repo tree scan):

docs/architecture.md

docs/contracts.md

docs/runbook.md

.github/workflows/* (presence indicates CI exists)

Churn risk detection (heuristic)

RepoPulse must compute “churn risk” using configurable rules, e.g.:

high commit count with no tags/releases,

README Status block unchanged,

high ratio of refactor/chore commits,

repeated changes to same few files,

contracts changing frequently without version marker.

Must label this as a risk (not a definitive judgment).

Green/Yellow/Red (RYG) scoring

Configurable thresholds and conditions.

Output must include: status_ryg + explanation fields (why it’s Yellow/Red).

Traceability

Every computed status and risk flag must store “evidence”: the inputs used (counts, timestamps, last CI conclusion, etc.).

Save run metadata for each execution.

Deep-dive support (local download workflow)

RepoPulse should support generating a “deep dive queue” CSV listing Yellow/Red repos, including:

clone URL

suggested focus areas (docs missing, CI failing, contract churn)

RepoPulse does not need to run the deep analysis itself in MVP, but must prepare the queue.

Minimal working MVP runs locally

Works on Windows/macOS/Linux.

SQLite DB for snapshots.

Simple config-driven rules.

ASSUME

GitHub only (no GitLab).

Public repos.

Local laptop execution.

Python 3.11+.

Common libs allowed: httpx/requests, pydantic, typer, sqlite, pandas, jinja2 (if needed), streamlit (if chosen).

DELIVERABLES YOU MUST PRODUCE IN YOUR ANSWER

A) Folder structure proposal including:

configs/ (signal rules + scoring thresholds)

schemas/ (snapshot/report schema)

app/ modules

data/ sqlite db path

exports/ csv outputs

B) CLI design with examples:

repos add --url ... --owner ...

snapshots run --config configs/default.yaml

report weekly --since 2026-02-11 --out exports/weekly.csv

dashboard run

deepdive queue --out exports/deepdive_queue.csv

C) Config formats

A scoring config that defines:

required files list

RYG thresholds

churn risk rules

D) Data schemas (Pydantic or JSON Schema)

RepoSnapshot schema

WeeklyReportRow schema

RunMetadata schema

E) Python code skeleton

app.py (Typer)

github_client.py (API wrapper + rate limit handling)

collector/ (signals: commits, actions, issues, releases, readme, tree scan)

scoring/ (RYG + churn risk)

storage/ (sqlite models + upsert snapshots)

reporting/ (csv export)

dashboard/ (minimal UI)

logging + unit test stubs

F) Acceptance criteria checks

For each repo snapshot:

required fields present (timestamps, counts)

status_ryg computed with explanation

risk_flags computed with evidence

For each run:

run metadata saved (timestamp, config hash, repos processed count, failures list)

csv files written successfully

OUTPUT RULES

Do NOT ask clarifying questions.

Give copy-pastable code blocks and file contents.

If long, show representative files fully and summarize the rest.

MVP should be runnable without any external services besides GitHub API.

Clearly mark where to plug in optional enhancements (notifications, deeper local analysis).

RUN METADATA

Save run.json per execution including:

run_id

timestamp

repos_processed

failures (repo + error)

config_used path + hash

API mode: token/no-token

scoring version

output paths (csv, db)

NOTES ON “DEVELOPER REPO HYGIENE” (what devs should include)

RepoPulse should detect and report whether each repo has:

Required (minimum)

README “Status” section: milestone, next deliverable date, how to run, known blockers.

Recommended

docs/architecture.md

docs/contracts.md (schemas/APIs/event contracts)

docs/runbook.md

.github/workflows/ci.yml (or equivalent) for CI

RepoPulse must not fail if these are missing; it should mark as risk flags and factor into RYG scoring.
